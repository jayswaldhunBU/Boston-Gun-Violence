Team 5

Gun Violence Analysis:

Project Summary: Gun violence in District 4 is more severe than in the rest of Boston, and Councilor Worrell, a Boston City Councilman for District 4, seeks to understand the underlying reason for that, and further understand the gun violence in the Boston area. In the base analysis, there are two essential questions: What is the rate of gun violence in District 4? How does this compare to the rest of the city? As for the extensional analysis, we combined an understanding of gun violence in Boston together with other social, cultural, and economic elements.

Team Progress: For base analysis, we approached from two perspectives: city councils and police councils, which shows that District 4 appears to have more frequent gun violence incidents, that have significant features in terms of shooter’s race, gender, and ethnicity. The incidents also show a pattern time-wise. As for external analysis, we focused on the nearby places where incidents happened to seek a correlation. We also analyzed the school’s drop rate to see if that’s related to gun violence
